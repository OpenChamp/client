# OpenChamp
 OpenChamp is an attempt at an Open Source League of Legends competitor, post the Vanguard update. 
 
 The goal is to allow anyone anywhere to play, commit and enjoy the game however they'd like. The source code for the server and client will be hosted on github for all to enjoy!

 This is in the very _VERY_ early stages and will not be ready for some time, but I will push releases when progress is far enough to be enjoyed!

 If you'd like to contribute or just hang around, I've created a Discord

 Thanks!
